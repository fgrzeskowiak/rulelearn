 * Annotation used for methods that:<br>

 * is not safe from the view point of the inner consistency of the encompassing class; such references are generally obtained faster,
 * but are intended only to access (read) elements of an array, and not to remove or replace any of array's elements;
 * if such modifications are required, first the returned array should be cloned to obtain a copy of that array,
 * and all the modifications should be performed on the copy;<br>
 * (2) assume (a priori or for some parameter values) that at least one of the input parameters passed to the method is an array reference
 * that is not going to be used to modify that array outside the method once the method returns;<br>
 * (3) assume (a priori or for some parameter values) that at least one of the input parameters passed to the method is an object that contains
 * a reference to an array (or references to arrays) that is (that are) not going to be used to modify that array (that arrays)
 * outside the method once the method returns.
