/**
 * Prunes lists of rule conditions {@link RuleConditions} using rule conditions evaluators {@link RuleConditionsEvaluator}.
 * Aims at reducing the number of rule conditions to only those, which are necessary to keep covered given objects. 
 * Rule conditions are removed in an iterative procedure which consists of three steps.
 * 
 * First, each rule conditions that can be removed are put on a list. If the list is non-empty, then one of the rule conditions
 * can be removed. Otherwise, the checking is stopped.
 * Second, the worst rule conditions are selected from the list according to the specified rule conditions evaluators, which are
 * considered lexicographically.
 * In case of a tie between two or more rule conditions, with respect to all rule conditions evaluators, rule conditions with
 * the smallest index on the list of rule conditions are selected.
 * Then, selected rule conditions are pruned (removed), the list of rule conditions that can be removed is updated, and the whole procedure repeats.
